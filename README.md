Powerball description-
This Python program generates random Powerball numbers by selecting 5 main numbers from the range 1 to 69 and 1 Powerball number from the range 1 to 26. It then displays the Powerball numbers with 4 spaces between the Powerball number and the main numbers. The program uses a while loop to ask the user if they want to play again. If the user enters "yes," the loop continues, generating a new set of Powerball numbers; otherwise, the program exits.
